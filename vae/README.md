# Implementing Variational Autoencoder (VAE) in Python from Scratch
In this article, we'll delve into the implementation of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) using Python and TensorFlow/Keras. Variational Autoencoders are powerful generative models that learn to reconstruct data and generate new samples from a learned latent space distribution. We'll use the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits as an example to demonstrate how VAEs can learn to generate new digit images.

## Problem Description: MNIST Dataset
The MNIST dataset consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). Our goal is to train a Variational Autoencoder that learns a low-dimensional representation of these images and can reconstruct them accurately. Additionally, we aim to generate new digit images from the learned latent space.
